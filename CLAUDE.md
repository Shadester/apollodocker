# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This appears to be a new/empty repository named "apollodocker". The directory structure suggests this may be intended for an Apollo GraphQL project with Docker integration, but no code has been implemented yet.

## Development Setup

Since this is currently an empty repository, future instances should:

1. Initialize the project structure based on the intended technology stack
2. Set up appropriate build tools and package management
3. Configure Docker containers if this is indeed a Docker-based project
4. Establish testing frameworks and linting rules

## Architecture Notes

No existing architecture to document. When code is added, this section should be updated with:

- Project structure and key directories
- Technology stack decisions (Apollo GraphQL, Docker, etc.)
- Build and deployment patterns
- Testing strategies

## Commands

No commands available yet. When the project is set up, common commands should be documented here such as:

- Build commands
- Test execution
- Linting and formatting
- Docker operations (if applicable)
- Development server startup

This file should be updated as the project evolves and code is added.
